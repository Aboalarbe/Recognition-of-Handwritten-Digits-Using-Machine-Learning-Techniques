# Recognition-of-Handwritten-Digits-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

Handwriting has continued to persist as a means of communication and recording information in day-to-day life even with the introduction of new technologies. Given its ubiquity in human transactions, machine recognition of handwriting has practical significance, as in reading handwritten notes in a PDA, in postal addresses on envelopes, in amounts in bank checks, in handwritten fields in forms, etc.
In our paper we aimed to recognize and predict handwritten digits (0:9) based on using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network and PCA.
A combination among two stages of machine learning and image processing is created to build our handwritten digits recognizer system. To get this high accuracy, K-means clustering used in image segmentation and PCA combined with ANN, KNN and Decision tree machine learning algorithms. Also LDA combined with ANN, KNN and Decision tree machine learning algorithms. The high accuracy obtained while using PCA combined with ANN.
Itâ€™s planned to use deep learning techniques instead of image segmentation algorithms to obtain a high performance in the learning processes.
